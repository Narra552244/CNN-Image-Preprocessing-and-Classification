 CNN Image Preprocessing and Classification

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and classification. It includes preprocessing techniques and model implementation to enhance image quality and optimize neural network training.

## Features:
- **Image Preprocessing:** Includes various techniques such as resizing, normalization, augmentation, and denoising to prepare images for deep learning models.
- **CNN Model Implementation:** A deep learning model built using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification tasks.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Model training with performance metrics including accuracy, loss visualization, and confusion matrix analysis.
- **Dataset Handling:** Efficient loading, augmentation, and batching of image datasets for training.
